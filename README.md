Schedule Ruby on Rails  

A API that allows users to create a schedule with appointments. Schedules can be created, updated (by adding appointments), modified (only by removing appointments), or deleted. Appointment can belong only to 1 schedule, can be created or deleted, and cannot be modified. Appointments cannot overlap (e.g, first appointment starts at 12pm and ends at 3pm, so no other appointments can be created with start time between 12pm and 3pm within the same schedule). Built with Ruby on Rails.
